# React Forms Processor

This project comprises a number of packages that can be used to easily create forms for React applications using different rendering implementations. The "core" package provides the basic React components for defining forms. The main `Form` component can then be assigned a `renderer` for rendering the fields in the form (currently only an [Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/) renderer is provided - other renderers will be added soon).
